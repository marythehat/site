    <h2>Early Life</h2>
  <p>
    Dr. Oscar Zephestus, known publicly as Dr. Z, was born in 1979 in the small town
    of Pickett, Missouri. Quiet and withdrawn as a child, in schools he was seen
    as a moron and a loser due to a lack of awards or sports trophies to his name.
    Teachers mistook his silence for ignorance, and classmates measured worth in
    medals he never cared to win.
  </p>

  <p>
    This did not bother the innovative Dr. Z, as he was content to go straight back
    home after school to tinker in his father’s garage. In fact, it seemed all he
    did was tinker in his father’s garage—radios, fans, broken clocks, and anything
    else that could be taken apart and improved, or at least understood.
  </p>

  <p>
    Oscar’s habits worried his mother, so she did as most mothers do: she made a rule.
  </p>

  <p><strong>
    “When I was about ten years old she told me… in order to succeed in one field,
    you must be creative in all. No pulling apart Dad’s lawn mower until after dinner.”
  </strong></p>
<h2>The Kitchen Years</h2>
  <p>
    It seems nothing is new under the sun, and even the moms of geniuses are like this.
    Lucky for her, helping with dinner actually kicked off a love for cooking; and
    that love would quietly build our future. Oscar learned ratios before equations,
    timing before theory, and precision before prestige. The kitchen became his
    second laboratory.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may know Dr. Z as the inventor of the Flying Automobile, Instant Television,
    and nefarious AdBots, but where did it all begin? Well, it began where everything
    is cooked up: the kitchen.
  </p>
<h2>The CookItRite</h2>
  <p>
    At the ripe age of twenty, Dr. Z established his name with the release of the
    CookItRite. The C.I.R. was a miracle oven the size of a toaster, but it had the
    power and accuracy of Simo Häyhä. It could bake a cake or reheat pizza in seconds,
    adjusting heat with surgical precision.
  </p>

  <p>
    With the funds from this appliance hit, Dr. Z was able to pay for all sorts of
    expensive equipment for new inventing, finally trading garage scraps for polished
    steel and humming servers.
  </p>
<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    On a search for style rather than blandness within the design of his creations,
    Dr. Z went on a world tour, seeking something that rang futuristic but also bled
    comfort from the past. In Japan, he met visionary Hayao Miyazaki, who taught him
    how to make the future look natural, not sterile.
  </p>

    “Robots do not need to be imposing threats of the future; they can be comfortable and friendly, something to welcome.”
