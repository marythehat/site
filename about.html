    Dr. Oscar Zephestus, known publicly as Dr. Z, was born in 1979 in the small town
    of St. Joseph, Missouri. Quiet and withdrawn as a child, he spent most of his
    time alone—disassembling appliances, sketching impossible machines, and
    imagining systems that worked better than the ones around him.

    His constant tinkering eventually worried his mother, who struck a compromise:
    no inventing until dinner was made. What began as a boundary quickly became a
    revelation. Cooking, Dr. Z discovered, was simply another system—one plagued by
    inconsistency, waste, and human error.
  </p>

    As his fascination with food grew, so did his ambition. Dr. Z began applying
    engineering principles to the kitchen, convinced that meals could be optimized
    the same way machines were. Precision, repeatability, and efficiency became his
    guiding philosophy.

    “Why cook,” Dr. Z later asked, “when perfection can be automated?”
